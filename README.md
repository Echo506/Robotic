🤖 **Robotics: My First Steps** 🚀

Hello everyone! 👋 This marks my **first dive into the world of Robotics**, and to get familiar with the components and concepts, I've started by watching basic YouTube videos as part of a Systems Engineering project for my degree. 🎓 I'll be adding the documents and links to the references section in case anyone wants to check them out. 😉 Soon, I'll be sharing more resources and details about my learning journey! 💡✨
